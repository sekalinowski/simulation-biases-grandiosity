Memory and future thinking biases in narcissistic grandiosity. 

NaM_analyses_Github.R contains the code used to conduct the analyses reported in Finch*, Kalinowski*, Hooley, & Schacter. This includes manipulation checks, linear mixed effects models predicting subjective ratings, models predicting objective detail measured with the Autobiographical Interview, and assumption checks of these models. We also include post-hoc analyses assessing how the agency of the cue word impacts these results, and checking for the influnce of covariates on our effects of interest. Data files should be in the same folder as the R code.

Data for Study 1 are in NaM_Study1_Github.csv, which contains a row for each trial and columns for trial type (stimulus and task cue), questionnaires, subjective ratings of each event, and objective detail from the automated Autobiographical Interview scoring. Sixty events also contain manual scores of internal and external objective detail, used to validate the use of the automated approach.

Data for the Replication are in NaM_Rep_Github.csv, which has the same data structure as the Study 1 data.
